    <h4 id="story">
        <P> Piano prodigy Kousei Arima dominated the competition and has become famous among child musicians.</P>
        <P> After his mother, who was also his instructor, died, he had a mental breakdown while performing at a piano
            recital at the age of eleven.</P>
        <p>
            As a result, he is no longer able to hear the sound of his piano even though his hearing is perfectly
            fine.
            Two years later, Kousei hasn't touched the piano and views the world in monochrome, without any flair or
            color.
        </p>
        He has resigned himself to living out his life with his good friends, Tsubaki and Watari, until, one day, a
        girl changes everything.
        <p>
            Kaori Miyazono, a fourteen-year old audacious, free-spirited violinist whose playing style reflects her
            manic personality,
            helps Kousei return to the music world and shows that it should be free and mold breaking unlike the
            structured
            and rigid style Kousei was used to.

            <h1>Kōsei Arima</h1>
            <p>Kōsei is a former child prodigy in playing piano, dubbed the "Human Metronome" for his near-inhuman
                mechanical accuracy, a product of his mother's overly strict methods of teaching.
            <p>His ability to play the piano with unparalleled precision led him to win many competitions across Japan.
                When
                his mother died, the resulting psychological trauma caused him to be unable to hear the sound of the
                piano,
                and he gave up playing.
            <p>Now, two years later, he takes up the piano again after being convinced by Kaori Miyazono, influenced by
                her
                emotional and unrestrained playing style. </p>
            <p>Kōsei eventually found himself falling in love with Kaori but held back due to the fact that she was
                Watari's
                love interest.</p>

            <h1>Miyazono Kawori</h1>
            <p>
                Kaori is Tsubaki's classmate, and is a free-spirited violinist who has drawn much criticism from judging
                panels due to her unwillingness to adhere strictly to the score, but is highly favored by audiences that
                hear her playing.</p>
            <p> Kaori first met Kōsei when she asked Tsubaki to set her up with Watari, and eventually convinced Kōsei
                to play the piano again, first as her accompanist and later in a piano competition.
